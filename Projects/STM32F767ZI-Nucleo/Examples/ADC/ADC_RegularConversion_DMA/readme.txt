@par Example Description 

This example describes how to use the ADC1 and DMA to transfer continuously 
converted data from ADC1 to memory.

The ADC1 is configured to convert continuously ADC_CHANNEL_10.

Each time an end of conversion occurs the DMA transfers, in circular mode, the
converted data from ADC1 DR register to the uhADCxConvertedValue variable.

In this example, the system clock is 216MHz, APB2 = 108MHz and ADC clock = APB2/4. 
Since ADC1 clock is 27 MHz and sampling time is set to 3 cycles, the conversion 
time to 12bit data is 12 cycles so the total conversion time is (12+3)/27= 0.55us(1.81Msps).


User can vary the ADC_CHANNEL_10 voltage by applying an input voltage on pin PC.00 (pin3 connector 9) 
(e.g. using function generator).

STM32 board's LEDs can be used to monitor the transfer status:
  - LED1 is ON when the conversion is complete.
  - LED3 is ON when there is an error in ADC initialization, in ADC channel configuration 
    or during conversion process.
The converted value is monitored through debugger: uhADCxConvertedValue variable.
The uhADCxConvertedValue read value is coded on 12 bits, the Vref+ reference voltage is connected 
on the board to VDD (+3.3V), the Vref- reference voltage is connected on the board to the ground.
To convert the read value in volts, here is the equation to apply :
Voltage = uhADCxConvertedValue * (Vref+ - Vref-) / (2^12) = uhADCxConvertedValue * 3.3 / 4096

@Note  If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),
       it is recommended to configure the latters as Write Through.
       This is ensured by configuring the memory attributes at MPU level in order to ensure cache coherence on SRAM1 and SRAM2.
       Please, refer to Template project for a typical MPU configuration.

@Note  If external memory is shared between several processors, it is recommended to configure it as Write Back (bufferable), shareable and cacheable.
       The memory base address and size must be properly updated.
       The user needs to manage the cache coherence at application level.

For more details about the MPU configuration and use, please refer to AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
