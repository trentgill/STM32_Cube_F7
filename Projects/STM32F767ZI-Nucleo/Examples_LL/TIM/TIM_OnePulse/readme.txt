@par Example Description

This example shows how to configure a timer to generate a positive pulse in
Output Compare mode with a length of tPULSE and after a delay of tDELAY;
This example is based on the STM32F7xx TIM LL API; peripheral initialization is done
using LL unitary services functions for optimization purpose (performance and size).

The pulse is generated on OC3.

This example uses 2 timer instances:

  - TIM1 generates a positive pulse of 50 us after a delay of 50 us. User push-button
    is used to start TIM1 counter. 
                                              ___ 
                                             |   |
    User push-button ________________________|   |________________________________
                                                            ___________
                                                           |           |
    OC1              ______________________________________|           |________
    (TIM1_CH1)                                <---50 us---><---50 us--->
                                                |            |_ uwMeasuredPulseLength
                                                |_ uwMeasuredDelay

  TIM1_CH1 delay and pulse length are measured every time a pulse is generated. 
  Both can be observed through the debugger by monitoring the variables uwMeasuredDelay and
  uwMeasuredPulseLength respectively.

  - TIM3 generates a positive pulse of 3 s after a delay of 2 s. TIM3 counter start
    is controlled through the slave mode controller. TI2FP2 signals is selected as
    trigger input meaning that TIM3 counter starts when a rising edge is detected on
    TI2FP2. The TIM3 output channel is mapped on the pin PB.0 (connected to LED1 on board
    NUCLEO-F767ZI). Thus LED1 status (on/off) mirrors the timer output level (active v.s. inactive).

    OC3 ______________________________________|                           |____
    (TIM3_CH3)                   <-----2s-----><----------3 s------------->
   


Both TIM1 and TIM3 are configured to generate a single pulse (timer counter 
stops automatically at the next update event (UEV).

Connecting TIM1 OC1 to TIM3 TI2 allows to trigger TIM3 counter by pressing
the User push-button.

@Note  If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),
       it is recommended to configure the latters as Write Through.
       This is ensured by configuring the memory attributes at MPU level in order to ensure cache coherence on SRAM1 and SRAM2.
       Please, refer to Template project for a typical MPU configuration.

@Note  If external memory is shared between several processors, it is recommended to configure it as Write Back (bufferable), shareable and cacheable.
       The memory base address and size must be properly updated.
       The user needs to manage the cache coherence at application level.

For more details about the MPU configuration and use, please refer to AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
