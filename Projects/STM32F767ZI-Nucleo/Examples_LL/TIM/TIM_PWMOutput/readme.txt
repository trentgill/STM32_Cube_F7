@par Example Description

This example describes how to use a timer peripheral to generate a 
PWM output signal and update PWM duty cycle; 
Example using the STM32F7xx TIM LL API, 
peripheral initialization done using LL unitary services functions
for optimization purpose (performance and size).

In this example TIM3 input clock (TIM3CLK) frequency is set to APB1 clock (PCLK1),
since APB1 pre-scaler is equal to 2 and it is twice PCLK1.
    TIM3CLK = 2*PCLK1
    PCLK1 = HCLK/2
    => TIM3CLK = (2/2)*HCLK = SystemCoreClock (216 Mhz)

To set the TIM3 counter clock frequency to 10 KHz, the pre-scaler (PSC) is
calculated as follows:
PSC = (TIM3CLK / TIM3 counter clock) - 1
PSC = (SystemCoreClock /10 KHz) - 1

SystemCoreClock is set to 216 MHz for STM32F7xx Devices.

Auto-reload (ARR) is calculated to get a time base period of 10 ms,
meaning a time base frequency of 100 Hz.
ARR = (TIM3 counter clock / time base frequency) - 1
ARR = (TIM3 counter clock / 100) - 1

Initially, the capture/compare register (CCR3) of the output channel is set to
half the auto-reload value meaning a initial duty cycle of 50%.
Generally speaking this duty cycle is calculated as follows:
Duty cycle = (CCR3 / ARR) * 100

The timer output channel is mapped on the pin PB.0 (connected to LED1 on board
NUCLEO-F767ZI). Thus LED1 status (on/off) mirrors the timer output
level (active v.s. inactive).

User push-button can be used to change the duty cycle from 0% up to 100% by
steps of 10%. Duty cycle is periodically measured. It can be observed through
the debugger by watching the variable uwMeasuredDutyCycle.

Initially the output channel is configured in output compare toggle mode.
@note The LED1 is not toggling. In fact, if the dutycycle is 0% so the LED1 is OFF. When pushing 
successively the user button, the LED1 is ON and its luminosity rises as the dutycycle value keep 
increasing.

@Note  If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),
       it is recommended to configure the latters as Write Through.
       This is ensured by configuring the memory attributes at MPU level in order to ensure cache coherence on SRAM1 and SRAM2.
       Please, refer to Template project for a typical MPU configuration.

@Note  If external memory is shared between several processors, it is recommended to configure it as Write Back (bufferable), shareable and cacheable.
       The memory base address and size must be properly updated.
       The user needs to manage the cache coherence at application level.

For more details about the MPU configuration and use, please refer to AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
