@par Example Description

This example shows how to enter the system in STANDBY mode and wake-up from this
mode using external RESET or wake-up interrupt.

In the associated software, the system clock is set to 216 MHz, an EXTI line
is connected to the user button thru PC.13 and configured to generate an 
interrupt on rising edge upon key press.
LED1 is toggled each 200 ms in order to indicate that MCU is in RUN mode.

When a rising edge is detected on the EXTI line, an interrupt is generated. 
In the EXTI handler routine, the wake-up pin LL_PWR_WAKEUP_PIN4 is enabled and the 
corresponding wake-up flag cleared. Then, the system enters STANDBY mode causing 
LED1 to stop toggling. 

Next, the user can wake-up the system in pressing the User push-button which is 
connected to the wake-up pin LL_PWR_WAKEUP_PIN4.
A rising edge on WKUP pin will wake-up the system from STANDBY.
Alternatively, an external RESET of the board will lead to a system wake-up as well.

After wake-up from STANDBY mode, program execution restarts in the same way as 
after a RESET and LED1 restarts toggling.

LED1 is used to monitor the system state as follows:
 - LED1 fast toggling: system in RUN mode
 - LED1 slow toggling: system in RUN mode after exiting from standby mode
 - LED1 off : system in STANDBY mode

These steps are repeated in an infinite loop.

@note To measure the current consumption in STANDBY mode, remove JP5 jumper 
      and connect an ampere meter to JP5 to measure IDD current.     

@note This example can not be used in DEBUG mode due to the fact 
      that the Cortex-M7 core is no longer clocked during low power mode 
      so debugging features are disabled.

@Note  If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),
       it is recommended to configure the latters as Write Through.
       This is ensured by configuring the memory attributes at MPU level in order to ensure cache coherence on SRAM1 and SRAM2.
       Please, refer to Template project for a typical MPU configuration.

@Note  If external memory is shared between several processors, it is recommended to configure it as Write Back (bufferable), shareable and cacheable.
       The memory base address and size must be properly updated.
       The user needs to manage the cache coherence at application level.

For more details about the MPU configuration and use, please refer to AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F767xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-F767ZI
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.

  - NUCLEO-F767ZI Set-up
    - LED1 connected to PB.0 pin
    - User push-button connected to pin PC.13 (External line 15 to 10)
    - WakeUp Pin LL_PWR_WAKEUP_PIN4 connected to PC.13

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
