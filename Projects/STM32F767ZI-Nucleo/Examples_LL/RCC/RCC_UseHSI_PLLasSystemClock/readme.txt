@par Example Description

This example shows how to modify the PLL parameters in run time.

In this example, the toggling frequency of the green LED1 depends on the system clock 
frequency and, each time the user-button is pressed, the PLL switches between two configurations.
This make the LED1 blinking speed to highlight the system clock frequency changes.

In this example, after start-up, SYSCLK is configured to the max frequency using the PLL with
HSE as clock source.
Then, at user-button press, an automatic switch is done between PLL with HSI as clock source (SYSCLK
set to 40MHz) and PLL with HSI as clock source (SYSCLK set to 216MHz). 
LED1 will toggle differently between the 2 configurations (quick toggle with HSI configuration at 216MHz).

To detect a problem with PLL configuration, switch USE_TIMEOUT can be enabled. Then in case of issues, 
LED1 will toggle every 1 second.
Note: "uwFrequency" variable can be added in LiveWatch to monitor the system clock frequency.

@Note  If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),
       it is recommended to configure the latters as Write Through.
       This is ensured by configuring the memory attributes at MPU level in order to ensure cache coherence on SRAM1 and SRAM2.
       Please, refer to Template project for a typical MPU configuration.

@Note  If external memory is shared between several processors, it is recommended to configure it as Write Back (bufferable), shareable and cacheable.
       The memory base address and size must be properly updated.
       The user needs to manage the cache coherence at application level.

For more details about the MPU configuration and use, please refer to AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
