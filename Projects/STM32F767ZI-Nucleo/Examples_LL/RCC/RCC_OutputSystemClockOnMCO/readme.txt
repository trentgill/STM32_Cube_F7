@par Example Description

This example describes how to configure MCO pins (PA8 and PC9) to output the system clock.

At start-up, USER button and MCO pin are configured. The program configures SYSCLK
to the max frequency using the PLL with HSE as clock source.

The signal on PA8 and PC9 can be monitored with an oscilloscope
to check the different MCO configuration set at each button press.
Different configuration will be observed
 - HSI frequency with frequency value around @16MHz.
 - PLLCLK frequency value divided by 4, hence around @54MHz.
 - SYSCLK frequency value divided by 2, hence around @108MHz.
 - HSE frequency value divided by 2, hence around @4MHz.

When user press User push-button, a LED1 toggle is done to indicate a change in MCO config.

@par Keywords

@Note  If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),
       it is recommended to configure the latters as Write Through.
       This is ensured by configuring the memory attributes at MPU level in order to ensure cache coherence on SRAM1 and SRAM2.
       Please, refer to Template project for a typical MPU configuration.

@Note  If external memory is shared between several processors, it is recommended to configure it as Write Back (bufferable), shareable and cacheable.
       The memory base address and size must be properly updated.
       The user needs to manage the cache coherence at application level.

For more details about the MPU configuration and use, please refer to AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F767xx devices.

  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-F767ZI board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - NUCLEO-F767ZI Set-up
    - Connect the MCO pin to an oscilloscope to monitor the different waveforms:
      - PA.08: connected to pin 23 of CN12 connector for Nucleo-144 (MB1137)
      - PC.09: connected to pin 1 of CN12 connector for Nucleo-144 (MB1137)

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
